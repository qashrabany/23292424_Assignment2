# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools UsedFor this project I have used “ChatGpt” as an AI assistant. It helped me to code development, problem understanding, error debbuing and documentation support
•	Code Development: by ChatGpt it helps to design and implement  key functions like parse_weathe_question() and generate_weather_response()
•	Problem Understanding: Chatgpt explained the logic and  purpose of each function step by step and also helped to decide flowchart and attribute detection. 
•	Error Debugging: to work on this project, faced multiple errors, pasted the error to chatgpt and askes issues helped to debug the error and fixed the issues.  Like I got error in location. ChatGpt helped to fix the error.
