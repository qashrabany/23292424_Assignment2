# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools UsedFor this project 
Used “ChatGpt” as an AI assistant. It helped me to code development, problem understanding, error debbuing and documentation support
•	Code Development: by ChatGpt it helps to design and implement  key functions like parse_weathe_question() and generate_weather_response()
•	Problem Understanding: Chatgpt explained the logic and  purpose of each function step by step and also helped to decide flowchart and attribute detection. 
•	Error Debugging: to work on this project, faced multiple errors, pasted the error to chatgpt and askes issues helped to debug the error and fixed the issues.  Like I got error in location. ChatGpt helped to fix the error.  

## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
Applied several international prompting strategies to get guidance. 
•	Step-by-step prompting:  for this project I have asked ChatGPT to explain each function like parse_weather_question and generate_weather_response in a very clear, logical steps. By this it makes easier to understand and the purpose and flow of the program in a better way.   
•	Clarification prompting:  sometimes it was tough to understand a concept or line of code , then I asked ChatGPT like “ why used this line”,  “why need to convert lowercase” and “what is the return type” 
•	Iterative refinement: provided my own code and asked ChatGPT to improve it gradually, for example, to make it detect attributes, return structured data, or add flowcharts.
•	Context-based prompting: Included the context of the project, and prompt ChatGPT could tailor its explanations and examples accordingly.
•	Verification prompting: when got any answer from ChatGPT I asked to double-check answers to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## What Worked Well?
successful implementation of the question parsing function (parse_weather_question). Because by this can accurately extract key information from NLP questions, such as location, time (today/tomorrow/day after tomorrow), and weather attributes (temperature, precipitation, or general).
•	When the user’s input varies in wording or capitalization, making the system more user-friendly and intelligent, this function works robustly. its makes able to convert unstructured questions into structured data, to generate a strong foundation generate a weather response accurate and meaningful. 

## What Would You Do Differently?
Due to time constraints and other subject pressures, I would otherwise integrate a real-time weather API.  Then it would allow the system to provide lice, accurate forecasts for any location and date, and also include more attributes like wind speed, humidity, and extended hourly forecasts, and enhance the NLP that can answer more diverse question formats and symptoms, that is chance of showers, hot or cold, next week, and making the system more user-friendly and flexible. 

## Final Thoughts
In this project, gained knowledge on programming and NLP, hands-on experience in parsing user questions, extracting structured data, and generating meaningful responses. The main important thing is how to do a real-life programming real life project. Using ChatGPT as an AI assistant makes it easier to understand programming logic more clearly. Learned step-by-step problem-solving and improved code quality knowledge. Strengthened my skills in building intelligent user-friendly systems and learn to integrate AI tools into practical applications.
